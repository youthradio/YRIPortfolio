With assistance from UC Berkely's 'iSchool', Youth Radio and NPR asks viewers what was the best dish in their area they could find for under $5. What this map holds are all the submissions from these various people around America.

"Young people want meals that are quick â€” and also fresh and healthful and interesting. But can they get all of that for less than five bucks? Youth Radio and NPR asked you to send in pictures of the best meals you can purchase for five bucks or less. Based on the submissions to the #5dollarchallenge, we're happy to report that a Lincoln can indeed buy quite a lot of deliciousness."
