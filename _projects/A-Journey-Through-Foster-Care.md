It all starts with a court-order: a social worker or judge determines it is not in your best interest to remain with your biological parents, and you are removed from their home. But you’re only a kid -- you still need a place to live and someone to care for you. You enter the foster care system, a state-run program that’s supposed to be temporary, until you can move to a more permanent, safe and caring home.
