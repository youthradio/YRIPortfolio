Youth Radio partnered with teens from the Little Rock Central High Memory Project to create a live tweet-style reenactment of the 60th anniversary of desegregation of the school. In September 1957, nine black teenagers took on the segregated American education system by enrolling in Little Rock's all-white Central High School. Now, 60 years later, we revisit the pivotal role the Little Rock Nine played in the Civil Rights Movement, and how it resonates with the continuing struggle for racial equity today.

Using #LR9Live, Youth Radio's Twitter feed will take us back in time to 1957, when the Little Rock Nine returned to Central High, ultimately breaking down the walls of segregation.
