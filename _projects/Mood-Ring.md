At Youth Radio, we understand young people--because we are young people. 
So we know, it's not always easy to handle emotions. Two things help: 

Noticing patterns in how you feel, and Reaching out to trusted others.

That's what Mood Ring helps you do! 
Hereâ€™s how it works: As often as you like (we recommend at least once a day), pick any combo of emojis that reflect how you're feeling. You can a little written reflection, too.
