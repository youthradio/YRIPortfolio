We tend to talk about gentrification as one story: newcomers displace long-time residents, erasing history and disrupting culture in the process. But living through dramatic neighborhood change always brings up many stories. Those stories--from West Oakland's people and places--are what this interactive is all about.

There's a lot to disagree about, when it comes to gentrification. But one thing seems beyond debate. If you're new to a place, it's good to know a thing or two about its history. So West Oakland's proud past is one of the most important stories you'll learn about in West Side Stories.
